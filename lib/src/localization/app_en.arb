  "infoDetails": "Uranium-Lead dating is a method of radiometric dating based on the decay of uranium isotopes to lead. This method is particularly useful for determining the age of rocks and minerals.",
  "basicsTitle": "Basics of Uranium-Lead Dating:",
  "basicsDetails": "Uranium isotopes are unstable and decay over time to lead isotopes. The decay of uranium isotopes to lead isotopes occurs in several steps through intermediates such as thorium isotopes. Ultimately, lead-206 and lead-207 remain, as these isotopes are stable.",
